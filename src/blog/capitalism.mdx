Unrestrained capitalism is leading nations down a path that will destroy society and nature. Not because maximising profit improves people's life, but because the society's **progress has devolved into a game of Monopoly** where people are scrambling to buy and own the most possible. People have been conditioned like pets to seek treats from their master. People have committed their life for consumerism. it leads is a path of destruction.

Look at nature, you can see the destruction caused by unrestrained capitalism. Nature where was designed to be in harmony. **There is no example in nature of one animal hoarding all the resources from the heard**.

Caring should go beyond the dollar profit. The basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money.  **The truama of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people perceive value. 

The solution isn't to get outraged. Let other people have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. Instead focus on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/). Be interesting and build people's curiosity. **You can turn a distructive individuals into productive one, by being inviting and providing helpful information. Focus on creating an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix or improve something you develop a relationship. A relationship is built on caring, and creating meaning. It takes determination and self awareness to not become infected with the greed created in market economies.

Society needs real minimalism. Minimalism that isn't about giving up what you need, it is giving up what you don't need; what is meaningless, to enjoy and care more about what is important.

Unrestrained capitalism is leading nations on a path that is destroying society and nature. People love nature, but have optimised their life for consumerism. Not because it improves their lives, but because the social **culture has devolved into a game of Monopoly where people are scrambling to buy and own the most possible**. People have been conditioned like pets be to satisfied with treats. We know from *the tragedy of the commons* this path leads to nature's destruction.

When you take the time to fix or improve something you develop a relationship. A relationship is built by caring about something, and creating meaning. Minimalism isn't about giving up what you need, it is giving up what you don't need; what is meaningless, to enjoy what you have. Itâ€™s not healthy believing everything is disposable.

Don't get outraged. Let other people have their opinion, you can't bully people into changing their beliefs. Instead focus on being charming.  Wait for them to ask, build their curiosity. **You can turn a bad group into a good group, by being inviting. Focus on creating an environment that attracts people - make a delightful place.**

- **A caring person** looks beyond surface value. Caring is a basic need everyone wants. It is the truama of modern life that has made caring painful and expensive. Money has infected how people judge value, by putting a price on everything. It takes a determination and self awareness to not become infected with the greed created from by market economies.

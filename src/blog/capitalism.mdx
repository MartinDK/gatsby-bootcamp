When we look at the history of Capitalism and when it worked well government played a big role in shaping markets and distributing the benefits across the population. While modern *Unrestrained Capitalism* is leading nations down a path that is destroying society and nature. Where the only measure of success is profit, **the economy has devolved into a game of Monopoly where the oligarchs battle it out to own all the assets in the economy**.

### Workers
We have an education system focused on creating workers. People have been conditioned to behave like trained animals; just like circus animals working for treats from their master. The economy has been optimised for consumption, rather then lifestyle.

### Corporations 
Capitalism has created corporations owned by oligarchs and destroyed the diverse competition in markets. Corporations have even infected social activism, and government. There is no institution not infected by corporate influence, politicians now argue to protect corporate profits, rather then the people.

### Social Welfare 
Even the basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money; caring has devolved into the profit incentive. **The fear of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people naturally share, basic human needs are denied to the poor. No one animal or species should hoard all the resources.

### Solution
The solution isn't to become outraged. Let everyone have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. People who want change need to focus on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/), and share interesting solutions that builds interest for change. The goal is to **turn an opponent into an ally, by being inclusive and accepting. 

> Creat an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix and improve something you build resilience. Social relationships are built with trust and resolving conflict to create shared strength. It takes symbiotic competition to not become infected with the concentration of power created by modern capitalism.

Society needs real minimalism. Minimalism that isn't about giving up what people need, it's about giving up what isn't needed, what is meaningless, to enjoy and care more about what is important. The world can be a better place.

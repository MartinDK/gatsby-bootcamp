Unrestrained capitalism is leading nations down a path that will destroy society and nature. Not because maximising profit improves people's life, but because the society's **progress has devolved into a game of Monopoly** where people are scrambling to buy and own the most possible. People have been conditioned like pets to seek treats from their master. People have committed their life for consumerism. it leads is a path of destruction.

It is clear to see that unrestrained capitalism is destroying nature. Nature evolved into balance because no one animal or species hoarded all the resources**. Capitalism has created a profit incentive to destroy nature, and the only opposing force is the social activists, and government.

The basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money; caring has devolved into the profit incentive. **The fear of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people naturally share, basic needs are denied without money. 

The solution isn't to get outraged. Let other people have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. Instead the focus needs to be on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/), and share interesting solutions that builds people's curiosity. **You can turn a distructive individual into productive one, by being inviting and accepting. Focus on creating an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix or improve something you develop meaningful relationships. All social relationships are built on caring, and creating shared meaning. It takes determination and self awareness to not become infected with the greed created by uncontrolled capitalism.

Society needs real minimalism. Minimalism that isn't about giving up what people need, it's about giving up what you don't need; what is meaningless, to enjoy and care more about what is important. The world can be a better place.

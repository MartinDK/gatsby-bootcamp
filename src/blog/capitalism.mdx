When we look at the history of Capitalism, it worked well when government played a role in shaping markets and distributing the benefits across the population. Modern *Unrestrained Capitalism* is leading nations down a path that is destroying society and nature. Now companies measure most important measure is immediate profit, **the economy has devolved into a game of Monopoly where the oligarchs battle it out to own all the assets in the economy**.

Main stream media discussions on economics are nothing but *a sermon of economic theology*. Explanations of Capitalism have devolved into nothing but *populist political propaganda*. Modern capitalism doesnâ€™t resemble what created the prosperity that has benefited so many people.

### Workers

> People who don't have capital are workers, they earn from their effort, not their wealth.

We have a system focused on disempowering workers. Creating a class of people conditioned to behave like trained animals, working for treats from their master. The economy has been optimised to encourage consumption, rather then improving people's quality of life.

### Corporations 
Modern capitalism has created corporations owned by oligarchs, and destroyed the working class. Corporations have even infected social activism, and government. There is no institution not infected by corporate influence, politicians now argue to protect corporate profits, rather then people's health and family life.

### Social Value Distortions
Even the basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money; caring has devolved into the *profit incentive*. Kindness should be a sign of wealth, not conspicuous consumption. Why is a virtue an expensive character flaw under capitalism?

**The fear of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people naturally share, basic human needs are denied to the poor. No one animal or species should hoard all the resources.

### Solution
The solution isn't to become outraged. Let everyone have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. People who want change need to focus on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/), and share interesting solutions that builds interest for change. The goal is to **turn an opponent into an ally, by being inclusive and accepting. 

> Creat an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix and improve something you build resilience. Social relationships are built with trust and resolving conflict to create shared strength. It takes symbiotic competition to not become infected with the concentration of power created by modern capitalism.

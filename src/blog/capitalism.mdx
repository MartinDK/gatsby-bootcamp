I'm not an ideologue when it comes to capitalism and socialism, I see the benefit of both systems. If you look at the advanced economies they have used both systems in unison. 

Capitalism works well when there is competition. While unrestrained capitalism is leading nations down a path that is destroying society and nature. Not because maximising profit is evil, but because **the economy has devolved into a game of Monopoly where only a few people own all the assets**.

### Workers
We have an education system focused on creating workers. People have been conditioned to behave like trained animals; just like circus animals working for treats from their master. The economy has been optimised for consumption, rather then lifestyle.

Capitalism has created a plutocracy that is destroying the world by eliminating diverse competition. Capitalism has even infected social activism, and government. There is no institution not infected by greed, unrestrained capitalism destroy the competition needed to keep a the economy in balance.

### Manipulation 
The basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money; caring has devolved into the profit incentive. **The fear of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people naturally share, basic human needs are denied to the poor. No one animal or species should hoard all the resources.

The solution isn't to become outraged. Let other people have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. Instead the focus on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/), and share interesting ideas that builds curiosity. **turn a distructive individual into productive one, by being inviting and accepting. 

> Creat an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix or improve something you develop resilience. Social relationships are built  by resolving conflict, and creating shared strength. It takes symbiotic competition to not become infected with the concentration of power created by uncontrolled capitalism.

Society needs real minimalism. Minimalism that isn't about giving up what people need, it's about giving up what isn't needed, what is meaningless, to enjoy and care more about what is important. The world can be a better place.

I'm not an ideologue when it comes to capitalism or socialism, I can see the strengths of each. If you look at the history of advanced economies, they have used the best of each system. Economies evolve and are a political contruction influenced by the history and social pressures on each nation.

Today's capitalism has been corrupted; history shows Capitalism worked best when government played a role in helping the vulnerable. Today, **many econommies has devolved into a Monopoly game, where the oligarchs battle it out to own all the assets,** and mainstream media has become nothing but a sermon of *economic theology*. Today's has devolved into *political propaganda* that is creating poverty and destroying society and nature. 


### Workers

Everybody doesn't have the same access to capital. 

> Workers don't own capital, they earn from their effort, not their wealth.

The system/government is focused on disempowering workers. Creating a class of people conditioned to behave like trained animals, working for treats from their master. 

The economy has been optimised for consumption, not improving people's quality of life. It is people's search for happiness that drives peoples conspicuous consumption. 

### Corporations 
Capitalism has become corporations owned by oligarchs, and a disenfranchised working class. Corporations have infected social activism, and government. Corporate influence of politics, leads to politicians arguing to protect corporate profits, rather then people's health and family life.

### Social Value Distortions
Even the basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money; caring has devolved into the *profit incentive*, not just *conspicuous consumption*.


> Why is a virtue an expensive character flaw under capitalism?

**The fear of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people naturally share, basic human needs are denied to the poor.

### Solution
The solution isn't to become outraged. Let everyone have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing. People who want change need to focus on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/), and share interesting solutions that builds interest in change. The goal is to **turn an attract allies, by being inclusive and accepting. 

> Create an environment that attracts people - create *delightful* ideas.**

When you take the time to fix and improve something you build resilience. Social relationships are built with trust and resolving conflict.

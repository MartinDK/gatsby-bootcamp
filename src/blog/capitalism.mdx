Unrestrained capitalism is leading nations on a path that is destroying society and nature. Not because it improves their lives, but because the social **culture has devolved into a game of Monopoly where people are scrambling to buy and own the most possible**. People have been conditioned like pets be to work for treats. People have optimised their life for consumerism. We know from *the tragedy of the commons* this constant need for more, leads to a path of destruction.

Look around at nature, and you can see the destruction created by unrestrained capitalism. In nature everything is designed live in balance, **there is no example of one animal hoarding all the resources from the heard**.

Caring should go beyond the dollar value. The basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money. **The truama of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Putting a price on everything has distorted how people perceive value. 

The solution isn't to get outraged. Let other people have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. Instead focus on being **[charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/)**. Be interesting and build their curiosity. **You can turn distructive individuals into productive groups, by being inviting and providing helpful information. Focus on creating an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix or improve something you develop a relationship. A relationship is built on caring, and creating meaning. It takes determination and self awareness to not become infected with the greed created in market economies.

Society needs real minimalism. Minimalism that isn't about giving up what you need, it is giving up what you don't need; what is meaningless, to enjoy and care more about what is important.

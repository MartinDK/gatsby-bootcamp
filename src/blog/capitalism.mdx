I'm not an ideologue when it comes to capitalism and socialism, I see the benefit of both. If you look at the history of advanced economies, economists used the best parts of each system in unison.

Today's capitalism has been corrupted and doesnâ€™t resemble the system that created the prosperity people enjoy today. History shows Capitalism worked well when government played a role in distributing the benefits of wealth across the population. Today, **the economy has devolved into a game of Monopoly where the oligarchs battle it out to own all the assets in the economy**.

Main stream media has become nothing but *a sermon of economic theology*. *Today's Capitalism* has devolved into nothing but *populist political propaganda* that is creating poverty and is destroying society and nature. 


### Workers

Everybody doesn't have the same access to employment. 

> Workers don't own capital, they earn from their effort, not their wealth.

The system/government is focused on disempowering workers. Creating a class of people conditioned to behave like trained animals, working for treats from their master. 

The economy has been optimised for consumption, not improving people's quality of life.

### Corporations 
Capitalism has created corporations owned by oligarchs, and destroyed the working class. Corporations have infected social activism, and government. Corporate influence of politics, leads to politicians arguing to protect corporate profits, rather then people's health and family life.

### Social Value Distortions
Even the basic human instinct of caring has been corrupted by peoples dependance on money; caring has devolved into the *profit incentive* and not *conspicuous consumption*.

Kindness should be a sign of wealth. 

Why is a virtue an expensive character flaw under capitalism?

**The fear of poverty has made caring painful and expensive**. Having a price on everything has distorted how people naturally share, basic human needs are denied to the poor. No one animal or species should hoard all the resources.

### Solution
The solution isn't to become outraged. Let everyone have their opinions. You can't bully people into changing their beliefs. People who want change need to focus on being [charming](https://areomagazine.com/2017/10/28/how-not-to-de-radicalize-a-twitter-neo-nazi/), and share interesting solutions that builds interest for change. The goal is to **turn an opponent into an ally, by being inclusive and accepting. 

> Creat an environment that attracts people - create a *delightful* place.**

When you take the time to fix and improve something you build resilience. Social relationships are built with trust and resolving conflict to create shared strength. It takes symbiotic competition to not become infected with the concentration of power created by modern capitalism.

## Pre Event

My goal this year was to beat last years time of 10:52:35, but it was unlikely because I hadn't done many long rides, so my endurance was questionable. Also I didn't have a good sleep the night, I woke up at 3am and lay in bed till 4am. When I got up I took my HRV and it was very low. On top of this, I was feeling nervous and worried about the descent, and even thought about pulling out of the event. Luckily on the drive up the mountain from Mt Beauty I relaxed and was feeling more positive.

## Tips

- Don't have a long stop at Dinner Plain; recover while descending into Omeo.
- Weather conditions can change be prepared for cold and wet conditions.
- At the rest stops just refill and go - otherwise you waste a lot of time.
- Stop on the side of the road to limit time lost standing in que to use toilet.

## Nutrition

### Pre Event

For breakfast I had porridge.

### During Event

I started with a can of Red Bull in each drink bottle and topped them up with water. At the rest stops I refilled with 2 scoops SIS drink mix and a Hydralyte electrolyte tabs in each bottle. While riding I snacked on Gummies, Gels and Cliff Bars.

I drank regularly and only had two toilet stops; first half way up Mt Hotham and then at the Omeo rest stop.

Lunch at Dinner Plain was a chicken wrap with sundried tomatoe, which tasted bland but did the job.

At Omeo I had brownies that were very sugary, they helped boost my energy and digested well.

I had a Kind nutbar at Diggers Rest.

At Trapyard Gap I had Coke and a banana.

## Training

My training this year wasn't ideal, I didn't do enough long rides. My ftp 270W(Garmin) and VO2 55 ml/kg/min(Garmin) and. I generally followed the recommendations on my Garmin 745. I needed to do more endurance rides and climbing to improve my preperation.

### Event Training Rides

I did one training rides with Bicycle Network at Lake Mountain, but didn't do the climb up Mt Donna Buang.

## Final Preparations - Last Week

### Condition

Didn't feel 100% the week before the ride, I felt fatigued.

## The Event

The weather was perfect, sunny but not too hot, just a little light rain before Anglers Rest.

## Falls Creek Descent

Good conditions for the start, not too cold and didn't need long finger gloves.

## Towonga Gap

Road strong up Towonga, and road with the 10 hour group near the top, but lost contact maybe 100m before the top of the climb.

## Harrietville

The ride to Harrietville was at a good pace, and I didn't stop.

## Mt Hotham

I rode up Mt Hotham at a steady pace. For the first section up to the rest stop I rode with an older man and younger lady.

## Dinner Plain

Didn't stay long at Dinnner Plain, I just ate my lunch and filled my water bottles. I didn't need to use the toilets which saved time.

## Omeo

The ride to Omeo was comfortable except for the last hill where the 11 hour leader increased the pace. I had a short stop at Omeo and ate a brownie and used the toilet and left before the 11 hour group.

## Anglers Rest

Rode a comfortable pass to Anglers Rest. The 11 hour group caught up just before the twisty section into Anglers Rest. They rode away on the descent because there were breaks in the group.

I had a short stop in Anglers Rest, just filled my water bottles and ate a Kind Nut Bar

## WTF Corner and back of Falls Creek

Struggled, I had to get off the bike after 100m, just before the photographer. It was hard getting back on the bike for my photo. It was a struggle all the way up the steep part, and I had to get off and walf a number of times.

## Trapyard Gap

I had a short stop at Trapyard Gap, just ate a banana and drank my Coke.

## To the Finish Line in Falls Creek

The weather at the after Trapyard Gap was cooler and there was thunder but no rain. I rode and easy pace to the finish and enjoyed the views.

## Finish Line

I felt emotional crossing the finish line with everyone cheering. It was a hard ride. At the finishline I received a finishers jersey and ticket with my official times, small serve of pasta and a recovery drink.

Moving Time: 10:25:58 (Garmin)

## Tips

- You don't need a long stop at Dinner Plain; recover while descending into Omeo.
- Prepare for cold and wet and changing weather conditions.
- At the stops just refill and go - otherwise you waste a lot of time.

## The Event

Not recorded

## Falls Creek Descent

Good conditions for the start, it was cold, but I was well dressed. The descent into Mt Beauty was fast and went without any dramas, but I didn't like how fast and close some riders passed me. In Mt Beauty I stopped to give Nadia and Zara my Leggings, Jacket and toe warmers.

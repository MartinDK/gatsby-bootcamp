- Social groups form tribes on social media.

Politics shouldn't be tribal, it should be nation building. The role of politics is to bring people together around shared ideas.

- People want to be part of a tribe with shared values. 
- Social media is where tribes often form and communicate.
- People's views will adapt to fit the tribe to avoid being isolated. 
- In tribes, members will conform to shared goals and values.

- Successful nations are able to integrate tribes into a cohesive society.
- Tribes within a nation *can compete* and *work together*.
- Competition between tribes in a *functioning nation* doesn't lead to conflict.

- Healthy competition promotes peaceful and merit/consensus based hierarchy.
- Unhealthy competition leads to violent conflicts.

### Questions

- How is happiness created by the tribe identity?
- How do rewards shape the tribe?
  - value
  - status
- How do rewards shape people's identity/status in the tribe?

All groups aren't tribal. Groups connect people with shared *interest*. Tribes form around people with the same *beliefs*.

- Religion provides the role of connecting people with shared values.  
- Tribes connect people with shared business/cultures/location.
- Social groups are the people whom we spend time with, and have *personal relationships*.

### Modern Tribes

In modern society the workplace/business is where tribes are formed. A stable workplace builds a strong tribe. When employment is unstable it weakens the tribe. Society is made up of many workplaces/tribes. Community is built around the workplace and sports clubs. 

### How do tribes choose their leader?

The leader of tribe is the person in charge of the workplace. Employers have a big effect on employee's personal life.

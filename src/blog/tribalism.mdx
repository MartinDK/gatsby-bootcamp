In cities tribes don't form by location. Tribes are built around social groups. Densely populated locations have many tribes.

Not all relationships are tribal. Special interest groups connect people with shared views. Often single interest groups polarise views, and undermine tolerance. In politics this plays out as identity politics. It is another flavour of prejudice.

Good tribes work together to make a cohesive society.

- Everyone wants to be part of a tribe with shared values. 
- People will adapt to fit the tribe to avoid being isolated. 
- In tribes, members will conform to shared goals and values.

> Politics shouldn't be tribal, it should be nation building.

- Successful nations are able to integrate tribes into a cohesive society.
- Tribes within a nation compete or work with each other.
- Competition between tribes in a functioning *nation* doesn't lead to conflict.

- Healthy competition promotes peaceful and merit based hierarchy.
- Unhealthy competition leads to violent conflicts.

### Questions

- How is happiness created by the tribe/social group identity?
- How do rewards shape the tribe?
  - value
  - status
- How do rewards shape people's identity/status in the tribe?

- Religion provides the role of connecting people with shared values.  
- Tribes connect people with shared business/cultures/location.
- Social groups are the people whom we spend time with, and have *personal relationships*.

A stable workplace builds a strong tribe. When employment is unstable it weakens the tribe.

### How do tribes choose their leader?

The leader of tribe is the person in charge of the workplace. Employers have a big effect on employee's personal life.

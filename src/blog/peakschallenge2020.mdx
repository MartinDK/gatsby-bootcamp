## Pre Event
Going into this years Peaks Challenge with the goal of finishing the ride in under 10 hours, but in the last week decided it was too ambitious. To enjoy the ride it would be better just to relax and go at an easy pace, to get a feel for the course.

I went into this ride too heavy. When I had my crash on the bike, my diet was terrible and I ate too much. Then because of Christmas holidays in Jervis Bay and the road closures in Bright I missed out on a two weeks of training. My fitness was good, but I was in better condition in 2019 when I pulled out because I got sick.

## Nutrition
I took a lot of supplements that I don't know how much effect they had on my performance. I did drink a lot of beetroot juice the week before the ride, and I think that did help keep my heart-rate lower during the event. Before the ride I drank Endura Electrolyte drink with magnesium, which might of helped prevent cramps. My legs felt consistently strong through the ride.

The drinks I had for the ride tasted terrible, but the SIS Electrolyte (Blackcurrant and Lime flavour) drink provided on the ride helped keep my energy stable. I had some Endura Cola flavoured gels that did the job.

I drank a lot and had to stop regularly to pee.

At the first Lunch stop they had chicken and hummus wrap, didn't tasted ordinary but did the job.

Omeo I had some vegan brownies that tasted good and gave a boost to my energy.

I had a Vegemite scroll and Anglers Rest that tasted OK, and was another welcome piece of solid food.

## Training
My training wasn't structured. I did try and follow the recommendations that my Garmin 830 provided. Even though I lacked structure the amount of riding I did was generally good.

### Event Training Rides
I did two training ride Bicycle Network training ride. Lake Mountain and Kinglake Repeats. They went well, but it was at this point I realised that my 10 hour finish time was too ambitious.

## Final Preparations - Last Week

### Condition
Didn't feel 100% the week before the ride. I felt run down and a little sick. The last 3 weeks of training wasn't ideal.

## The Event 
The ride started at 6:55am. 
I completed the event in 11:39:05. Clock on finish line showed 11:20:53.

## Falls Creek Descent
Good conditions for the start, it was cold, but I was well dressed. The descent into Mt Beauty was good and went without any dramas, but I didn't like how fast and close some riders passed me. In Mt Beauty I stopped to give Nadia and Zara my Leggings, Jacket and toe warmers. I should have kept my toe warmers.

## Towonga Gap
Road strong up Towonga, and the road was dry for the descent and I caught up with Carlos at the bottom of the descent. Both of us got on the back of a group.

## Harrietville
The ride to Harrietville was fast and arrived we with the 10 hour group. Our group worked harder then I liked; to catch two groups in front of us. Carlos was lucky not to crash when a rider in front of him fell. The fallen rider was OK and got up. Harrietville I stopped to fill up the bottles and take a leak.

## Mt Hotham
The last 10km up Mt Hotham in the cold wet conditions was very hard. But the most difficult part of the ride was from the 5km sign to Dinner Plain. Cold, wet, windy and because it was an easy downhill run the cold really started to sap the heat from my body. That 5km seemed the longest and most difficult for the ride.

## Dinner Plain
At Dinner Plain all three of us met up Carlos, Matteo and myself. We were all cold, Matteo the coldest, Carlos seemed in good condition, I felt cold and was scared I was just going to get worst. Their didn't seem to be much information about what the conditions were in front of us. My legs at this stage were sore, but my energy felt OK for this point in the ride.

## Omeo
Luckily Carlos was positive he would continue, and then all of us decided to continue. I put a large plastic bag under my top. That really helped keep the cold out. Once we descended under the clouds, the road was dry and the temperature increased and all my clothes dried. From Mt Hotham to Omeo it was an easy ride with lots of fast but easy descents; very enjoyable. In Omeo I caught up with Matteo and refuelled. I took my time to eat some vegan brownies, and drink SIS Electrolyte.

## Anglers Rest
The ride from Omeo to Anglers Rest was nice, easy climbs, descents, flat sections and good weather. Carlos and I rode most of the way together. We had a short stop to eat a Vegimite Scroll and refill water bottles, walk across the wooden bridge and a quick pee behind the bushes while we waited for the 12hour group to leave. I started with the group, but went ahead with some other riders.

## WTF Corner and back of Falls Creek
I reached WTF Corner feeling better then expected. My legs were sore, but still feeling strong. I stopped to take a phot of the sign Zara made which was at the start of the climb. This was the start of the hardest climb of the day. Just after the photographer early in the climb someone fell in front of me, luckily I was able to avoid him and continue. I could see he hurt himself but, it wasn't anything serious. The Falls Creek climb was long and steep, and it really helped having Climb Pro on the Garmin. Seeing how the gradient allowed me to control my effort and see where it would get easier.

## Trapyard Gap
I stopped at Trapyard Gap for a while waiting for Carlos. I drank my Coke and had some Cliffbar lollies. Stretched my legs. After a while, I left without Carlos, turned out he had another flat, he had his first flat at the top of Hotham.


## To the Finish Line in Falls Creek

The ride from Trapyard Gap to Falls was easy but cold. It was getting cold again, and foggy. I was riding in the clouds. The descents in the fog were a little scary because I could only see 15m in front of me. At the same time it was nice and calm. I rode all the way on my own. I would pass riders, but then get passed. I had lots of short stops to pee, put on my neck warmer, hat, and take a photo. 

## Finish Line
I felt emotional crossing the finish line with everyone cheering. It was a hard ride. At the end of the ride I received a finishers jersey, small serve of pasta and a recovery drink.

## Post Event Recovery

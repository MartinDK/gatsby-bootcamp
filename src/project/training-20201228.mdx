## Training
I am training to improve my general cycling fitness. This week I have seen some improvement. My ftp has increased from 265W to 268W, also my VO2 is 52, after falling to 51 because of poor recovery. 

### Current
 - 268W @ 86kg (3.1 W/kg)
 - 52 VO2
 
### Goal
- FTP 300Watt @ 82kg (3.65 W/kg)
- 56 VO2
- Participate in 1 or 2 Zwift races each week.

### Typical Week
- 10 hr/week.
- 4-5 Zwift rides.
- Social ride on Sunday.

## Training Philosophy
- High volume and low intensity training to improve endurance.
- Intense training to improve resilience.
- Sprint training to improve strength.
- Gains/addaptation occurs during recovery.

## What I struggle with
- I regularly over train.
- I don't track calories and overeat when my energy is low.
- My training isn't structured.


#### Next Event:
Alpine Classic 2021 23rd & 24th January

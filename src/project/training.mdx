This page is about my training.

## Training
I am training to improve my general fitness, cycling endurance and FTP.

A typical week:
- Two 50km ride on my regular loop.
- Two Zwift rides.
- Social ride on Sunday.

## Training Philosophy
- High volume and low intensity is the best way to improve endurance.
- High heart rate training improves efficiency.
- Explosive training improves strength.

## What I struggle with
- As my fitness improves I tend towards over training.
- Training at too high an intensity.
- Over eating when my training load is high.
- Too much of my training is at a high heart rate.

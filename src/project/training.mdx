Notes about general fitness and cycling.

## Training Goal

I am training to improve my general fitness, cycling endurance and FTP.

## Weekly Training Load:

- Two 50km rides on my regular loop.
- Two interval sessions on Zwift.
- Social ride on Sunday.

## Training Philosophy

- High volume and low intensity focusing on endurance.
- High intensity VO2Max intervals; 2min 120% ftp + 2min 50% ftp rest.
- Explosive training improves strength.

## Where I go Wrong

- I tend to over train when my fitness improves.
- Too much training time spent in zone 3-4.
- Over eat after heavy training sessions.

#### Cycling Events:

- [Alpine Classic](./events)
- [Peaks Challenge](./events)

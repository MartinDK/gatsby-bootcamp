Notes about general fitness and cycling.

## Training
I am training to improve my general fitness, cycling endurance and FTP.

A typical training week:
- Two 50km rides on my regular loop.
- Two interval sessions on Zwift.
- Social ride on Sunday.

## Training Philosophy
- High volume and low intensity focusing on endurance.
- High intensity training improves efficiency.
- Explosive training improves strength.

## What I struggle with
- As my fitness improves I tend to over train.
- Train at too high an intensity.
- Over eating when my training load is high.

#### Upcoming Events:

Notes about general fitness and cycling.

## Training
I am training to improve my general fitness, cycling endurance and FTP.

A typical training week:
- Two 50km rides on my regular loop.
- Two interval sessions on Zwift.
- Social ride on Sunday.

## Training Philosophy
- High volume and low intensity focusing on endurance.
- High intensity VO2Max intervals; 2min 120% ftp + 2min 50% ftp rest.
- Explosive training improves strength.

## What I struggle with
- I tend to over train when my fitness improves.
- Train at too much in zone 3-4.
- Over eat after heavy training sessions.
